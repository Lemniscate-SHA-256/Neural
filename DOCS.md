# Differences between Neural and Tensorflow/Pytorch

1. Neural is more concise and readable, especially for users who want to focus on the model architecture rather than implementation details.

2. Focus on Model Definition

TensorFlow/PyTorch:
These frameworks require you to manually define every aspect of the model, including tensor shapes, forward passes, and training loops.

Neural:
Neural automates tensor shape propagation and ensures that layers are compatible. For example, if you add a Conv2D layer followed by a Dense layer, Neural will automatically insert a Flatten layer if needed.

3. Training Configuration

TensorFlow/PyTorch:
Training loops, data loading, and hyperparameter tuning require custom code.

Neural:
Neural provides built-in support for training configuration (e.g., epochs, batch size, optimizers) and can generate the corresponding training code for TensorFlow or PyTorch.

4. Interoperability
   
TensorFlow/PyTorch:
These frameworks are standalone and require effort to interoperate (e.g., converting models between them).

Neural:
Neural acts as a bridge between frameworks. You define your model once in Neural, and it can generate code for TensorFlow, PyTorch, or export to ONNX for broader compatibility.

5. Extensibility

TensorFlow/PyTorch:
Adding custom layers or operations requires writing low-level code in Python/C++.

Neural:
Neural allows you to define custom layers and activations in a simple, declarative way.

6. Learning Curve

TensorFlow/PyTorch:
These frameworks have a steep learning curve, especially for beginners or researchers who want to quickly prototype ideas.

Neural:
Neural is designed to be intuitive and beginner-friendly, allowing users to focus on the high-level design of their models without worrying about implementation details.

7. Use Cases

TensorFlow/PyTorch:
Ideal for production-grade deployments, custom research, and low-level experimentation.

Neural:

Ideal for:

- Rapid prototyping: Quickly test new architectures.

- Education: Teach neural network concepts without overwhelming students with boilerplate code.

- Interoperability: Generate code for multiple frameworks from a single source.

# Why Use Neural?
- If you want to quickly prototype neural networks without writing boilerplate code.

- If you need to generate code for multiple frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX) from a single source.

- If you’re teaching or learning neural networks and want to focus on architecture design rather than implementation details.
