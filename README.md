# Neural: A Neural Network Programming Language

Neural is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for defining, training, and deploying neural networks. With an intuitive syntax and powerful abstractions, Neural makes it easy to experiment with complex architectures like CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and Transformers.

## Features

- **Declarative Syntax**: Define neural networks with a clean, YAML-like syntax.
- **Shape Validation**: Automatic tensor shape propagation and validation.
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Generate code for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX.
- **Training Configuration**: Built-in support for epochs, batch size, and optimizers.
- **Extensible**: Easily add custom layers, activations, and loss functions.
